# Frontend Mentor - Recipe Page Solution

This is my solution to the [Recipe Page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm). This is the first project I built completely on my own. Previously, I had coded with the help of courses, but I realized that practicing alone through real challenges is much more effective. I found Frontend Mentor through research, and it really helped me start building projects independently.

Although I couldn’t get the Pro version of their site due to currency fluctuations in my country, I continued my efforts to learn and practice.
